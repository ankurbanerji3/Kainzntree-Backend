***Instructions for running the application on local machine***

1. You should have mysql workbench or XAMPP server configured. If not, then I would recommend using XAMPP server's MySQL database.
2. If you don't have XAMPP, simply download the appropriate installer from "https://www.apachefriends.org/". After that, install the application and set the "path" in user environment variable to the bin folder of mysql in the XAMPP directory on your PC.

3. Start Apache server followed by the MySQL server in XAMPP and open the phpMyAdmin by clicking on the "Admin" tab for MySQL. The first thing is to create a database "newdb" either directly on phpMyAdmin or using terminal.

4. Once its done, install the required libraries from requirements.txt.

5. Open terminal from the directory of the project and run these two commands --

	python manage.py makemigrations

	python manage.py migrate

6. After successfull migrations, run the command below to start the application --

	python manage.py runserver

7. Simply follow through the user interface and perform the necessary actions.
